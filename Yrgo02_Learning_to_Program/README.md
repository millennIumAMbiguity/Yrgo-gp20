## Assignments
1. Check that your [vocabulary](http://www.programmingforbeginnersbook.com/blog/expand_your_programming_vocabulary/#a-list-of-basic-programming-terms) is up to date. The page contains a really good starter list of words you really should learn.

  > **Note:** This will be on the exam in the future, together with other general programming terms.

2. Create a parabolic curves using straight lines. This should of course use a loop that modifies the positions of the lines. Here is guide on how to create
[parabolic curves](http://www.wikihow.com/Draw-a-Parabolic-Curve-(a-Curve-with-Straight-Lines)).

3. Make the lines gray and every third line black by using the modulus operator.


## Extracurricular
These are some quite hard extra assignments, during the next few lectures we will learn the skills needed to solve this. But feel free to try on your own.

1. Make a class for creating parabolic curves. Create a constructor that takes the following arguments: axis1, axis2, numberOfLines. Using this information you should be able to create almost any parabolic curve.

2. Using this new class create a composition with inspiration from [MathCraft](https://mathcraft.wonderhowto.com/how-to/create-parabolic-curves-using-straight-lines-0131301/). Bonus points for flashy colors and animations.

3. Make a cool `.gif` out of your project and share with the class. Processing can save each frame using [this function](https://processing.org/reference/saveFrame_.html).
