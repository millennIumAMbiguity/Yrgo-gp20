## Assignments
This assignment might be a bit hard so don't feel bad if you get stuck, just ask for help.

1. Draw a circle (ellipse) on screen.

2. Teleport the circle to the mouse when you press the mouse button.

3. Draw a line from the circle to the mouse while the mouse button is pressed.

4. Calculate the vector between the circle and the mouse.

5. Use the vector to give the circle direction (movement).

6. Adjust the speed in a way so it doesn't go too fast.

7. But still make it so a longer line makes it go faster then a short line.

8.  Make the circle bounce on the edges of the screen.

## Extracurricular
1. Create a new program that gives you a random vector. For example `(123, 72)` and the goal of the game(?) is to draw a vector on the screen with the mouse and get as close as possible to a vector of that size. Calculate the score and give the player feedback on his result.

2. Create your own vector class with the help of [Coding Math: Episode 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYOGtlY6xaM).
