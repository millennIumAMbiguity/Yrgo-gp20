## [06 - Class and Objects](https://github.com/yrgo/gp20/tree/master/Programming%20Fundamentals/06%20-%20Class%20and%20Objects)

## Assignments
1. Start by making a copy from the "Input and Movement" lesson assignment, so we get a  character that we can move on the screen.

2. Create a player class and move as much code out from the main file as possible.  
(Let time and delta time still be calculated in the main file)

3. Add the Ball class from this lesson.

4. Add size and color to the ball class.

5. Make the ball class handle bounces at the edge of the screen.

6. Create 10 balls that can bounce around the screen.

7. Check if the player collides with a ball.

8. Make some kind of Game Over screen when the player gets hit.


## Extracurricular
1. Create a ball manager class so we can keep the main file clean.

2. Add a new ball every 3 second (up to a max of 100 balls).

3. Make sure the new balls don't spawn on the player.
